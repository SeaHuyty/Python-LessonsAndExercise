# Machine Learing:

# Machine Learning is some sort of AI. It's a model or an engine that we give it lots of data.
# Machine Learning Project involves a number of steps:
#   1. Import the data
#   2. Clean the data: We don't feed duplicate data to our model, it may learn bad pattern with data.
#                      If there is data that is irrelavant or duplicates or incomplete, we should remove or
#                      modify them.
#   3. Split the Data into Training/Test Sets: We need to split our datas into two segments. One for training our
#                                              model, and the other for testing it, to make sure our model produces
#                                              the right result. For example: You have 1000 images of cats and dogs,
#                                              we can reserved 80% for training and another 20% for testing.
#   4. Create a model: Involves selecting an algorithm to analyze the data. The algorithm you choose depends on the problem
#                      you're trying to solve and input your data.
#   5. We need to train our model. We feed it with our training data. Then it will look for patterns in the data.
#   6. Make Predictions: After it look for patterns in our data, We can ask it to make predictions.
#   7. Evaluate and improve: We evaluate the predictions and measure their accuracy. Then we get back to our model and either
#                            select a different algorithm that is going to produce a more accurate result for the kind of problem
#                            we're trying to solve or fine tune the parameters of our model.
#                      Note: Each algorithm has parameters that we can modify to optimize the accuracy.

# Look up for tools and libraries that we use in machine learning projects.
# 1. Numpy: Provides a multidimensional array.
# 2. Pandas: A data analysis library that provides a concept called data frame. Data frame is two dimensional data structure similar to an excel spreadsheet.
# 3. MatPlotLib: A two dimensional plotting library for creating graphs on plots.
# 4. Scikit-Learn: provides common algorithms like decision trees, neutral networks and so on.
